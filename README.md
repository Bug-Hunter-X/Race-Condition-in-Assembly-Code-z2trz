This repository demonstrates a common race condition bug in assembly code.  The bug occurs when multiple threads try to modify the same memory location simultaneously. The provided solution shows how to fix this using atomic operations, ensuring thread safety. The original code is prone to unpredictable behavior due to data corruption, leading to potential program crashes or incorrect results. The solution demonstrates proper synchronization mechanisms for thread-safe memory access.
